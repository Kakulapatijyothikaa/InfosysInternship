Project Statement â€“ To develop a Convolutional Neural Networks model capable of detecting tumor in iris images.

The project, "Iris Tumor Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)," aims to introduce students to deep learning techniques in medical imaging, focusing on detecting tumors in iris images.

By using CNNs, for image classification, this project will help to understand how medical imaging tasks can benefit from deep learning, enabling early and accurate diagnosis of potential tumors.
